# Mental Health Fitness-Tracker
The Mental Health Fitness Tracker project focuses on analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels of individuals from various countries with different mental disorders. It utilizes regression techniques to provide insights into mental health and make predictions based on the available data. The project also provides a platform for users to track their mental health and fitness levels. The project is built using Python.

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn plotly.express
```
    
3. Download the project files and navigate to the project directory.

## Usage
1. Select the country and the mental disorder you want to analyze.
2. Select the year range you want to analyze.
3. Click on the "Analyze" button.
4. The app will display the results of the analysis.
5. Click on the "Predict" button to predict the mental fitness level of the selected country.
6. The app will display the predicted mental fitness level of the selected country.
7. Click on the "Track" button to track your mental fitness level.
8. The app will display the results of the tracking.

# SHOW DATA SET
```bash
df1.head()
```
```bash
df2.head()
```

# MERGING TWO DATASETS
```bash
data = pd.merge(df1, df2)
data.head()
